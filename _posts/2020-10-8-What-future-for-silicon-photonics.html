title: What future for silicon photonics ?
---

<p>
  Constructed on standard foundry (i.e. a process of manufacturing IC).
</p>

<p>
  Already deployed by Intel<sup>3</sup>.
</p>

<h3>A new way of increasing network speed</h3>

<p>
  Can piggy-back on an already-existing infrastructure both inside the data-center and in-between them.
</p>

<p>
  Photonics-enabled DPU which could be based on a risc-V photonic-enable CPU<sup>2</sup> or a similar IC with arm-core.
</p>

<h3>Photonic-computing, or the "continuous-flow manufacturing" of information technologies</h3>

<p>
  Photonics-enabled switch and photonic computing together create a computing-infrastructure comparable to "continuous-flow manufacturing" in factories, where information does not have to stop inside of a node's memory but can have a continuous flow in-between nodes.
</p>

<h4>The photonic CPU</h4>

<h4>Shared memory</h4>

<h3>Single-photon quantum-computing and distributed quantum-computing</h3>

<h4>Advantages over ion-trap and supraconductor-based technologies</h4>

<p>
  Increase stability of photons over other quantum object.
</p>

<h4>Transporting quantum information, and the need for a "continuous photonic-switch"</h4>

<p>
  Photon-based qubit are probably the only one to have the capacity of being transported, and more so of being transported over existing long-range infrastructure (i.e. fiber-optic cables). So even if a future quantum-computer is not based on photons, any hope of "transporting quantum information has to rely on photon-based qubit, and probably through the help of silicon-photonics.
</p>

<p>
  This is why a "continuous photonic-switch", probably based on silicon-photonics, is needed.
</p>

<h4>Distributed quantum-computing</h4>

<p>
  The same "continuous data-flow" can be implemented with quantum-computer if both the network interface and the quantum-computers are based on photonic technologies.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  Nimble design with optimization-based design of phtonics design<sup>2</sup>.
