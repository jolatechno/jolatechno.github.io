title: What future for silicon photonics ?
---

<p>
  Silicon-hotonics device (deice that use integrated circuit as optical decice) have come a long way in the past few years,
  and are now starting to be deployed (by Intel<sup>3</sup> for example).
</p>

<p>
  The strength of silicon-photonics,
  and what as allowed it to advance this quickly,
  is that it can be manufactured on a standard foundry (i.e. a proces for integrated-cricuit manufacturing).
</p>

<h3>A new way of increasing network speed</h3>

<p>
  Silicon-photonics device have quickly entered the data-center space beacause they use the same infrastructure (optical fiber) as current data-center.
  They have been used to overcome a limitation of classical fiber-optics switch,
  which is that current fiber-optics switch are currently electronic switch with some device to convert light to an electrical signal and back.
  This causes an increased latency, and limit the bandwidth of optical fibers.
</p>

<p>
  On of the recent solution to answer the boom in bandwidth between nodes inside a datacenter as been the introduction of smart-NICs and DPUs.
  DPUs (or Data Processing Units) are high-level network interfaces (often running their own operating system) which allow a higher level and dipper connectivity between nodes.
  DPUs are usully based on an ARM-based CPU,
  which makes a photonics-enable DPU more believable as a risc-V photonic-enable CPU<sup>2</sup> as already been produce.
</p>

<h3>Photonic-computing, or the "continuous-flow manufacturing" of information technologies</h3>

<p>
  Once we can efficiently transfer data through light in-between nodes,
  being able to compute using light at those nodes can start to make sence as the limiting factor could now be the conversion between light and electrical signal.
  Photonics-enabled switch and photonic computing together create a computing-infrastructure comparable to "continuous-flow manufacturing" in factories,
  where information does not have to stop inside of a node's memory but can have a continuous flow in-between nodes.
</p>

<h4>The photonic CPU</h4>

<h4>Shared memory</h4>

<p>
  The communication bewteen the CPU and its Random Access Memory (RAM) can also be done through light<sup>4</sup>,
  it then become feasible to access the RAM of other nodes at comparable speed and latency as your own RAM.
  This could drasticly improove our capacity to aglomarate multiple nodes as a single computer,
  since the current limitation in distributed computing is the dramatic difference between the latency and speed of the CPU's connections with its RAM
  and the latency and speed of the connection in-between nodes.
</p>

<h3>Single-photon quantum-computing and distributed quantum-computing</h3>

<h4>Advantages over ion-trap and supraconductor-based technologies</h4>

<p>
  A spin or supraconductor based qubit can change state if you look at it the wrong way,
  even if it has already been cooled to near-absolut zero.
  Single-photon qubits have already been shown to be dramaticly more stable,
  to the point of being able to travel hundreds of kilometers through existing optical fibers network<sup>5</sup>.
</p>

<h4>Transporting quantum information, and the need for a "continuous photonic-switch"</h4>

<p>
  Photon-based qubit are probably the only one to have the capacity of being transported,
  and more so of being transported over existing long-range infrastructure (i.e. fiber-optic cables).
  So even if a future quantum-computer is not based on photons,
  any hope of transporting quantum information has to rely on photon-based qubit,
  and probably through the help of silicon-photonics.
</p>

<p>
  This is why a "continuous photonic-switch" - probably based on silicon-photonics - is needed,
  as it allows the transport of a single-photon through a network without ever absorbing it (and so "destroying" its quantum information).
  A "continuous photonic-switch" would be a switch that allow a "continuous" or "direct" path from input to output,
  with part of the packet of information never being absorbed and re-emited (to achieve this the first part of the packet would have to be absorbed as in a classical switch,
  to read the destination and the provenence of the packet, but the part of the packet containing the quantum information would be routed un-read).

</p>

<h4>Distributed quantum-computing</h4>

<p>
  The same "continuous data-flow" can be implemented with quantum-computer,
  if both the network interface and the quantum-computers are based on photonic technologies.
  This would allow to route qubits between different quantum computer and to actually "glue together" quantum computers
  (k n-qubits quantum computers could be put together and actually the exact same capability as a k*n-qubits quantum computers).
</p>

<h3>The photnic FPGA - a gateway to a photonic future</h3>

<p>
  A photonic FPGA (Field Programable Gate Array) could enable a wide array of silicon-photonics application,
  and kickstart this revolution as normal FPGA kickstarted the silicon revolution.
  A phtonic FPGA could also have far-lower developement cost as a full photonic-CPU,
  as a FPGAs use a simple, repeting block.
</p>

<p>
  Since single photons (i.e. photon-based qubits) have most of the same optical property as "normal light",
  a well-designed photonic FPGA could also carry quantum information (if used in router for example),
  and could even be a small step toward a FPQGA (Field Programable Quantum Gate Array).
</p>

<h3>Optimization based design</h3>

<p>
  Optimization-based design of phtonics device<sup>2</sup> has been shown to be possible and open-source tools have already been developed.
  This allows for a nimbble and cheap design of silicon-photonics devices,
  and could make photonics-FPGA valible in a short time,
  potentialy kickstarting the "photonic revolution".
